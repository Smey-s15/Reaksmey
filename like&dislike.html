    <p class="center">I like reading. I only read during holidays when it is quiet peace and relax. During school, there are too many things going on. My mind can’t focus on the book. My favorite author is Stephen King. I love his horror books.</p>

    <p class="center">I spend at least 30 minutes everyday sitting in front of the mirror. Hehe, I sometimes talk to myself about positive thing or something I should change about myself. However, I spend most of those time acting in front of the mirror a lot. </p>

    <p class="center">I always chew my pencils and pens. This helps me to show my ownership of my properties. Nah, Kidding. It’s just my habit and also to help me with my stress in class. :D</p>

            <li>I love a Korean boy band(only one), EXO. I also love one Apop band, Why Don’t We. I love their taste in music. They have inspired me a lot both in acting and singing.</li>
            <li>I love chocolate. I think everything with chocolate taste good. Ice cream, drink, dessert, bread, snacks. Chocolate the taste of heaven, Yum.</li>
            <li>I love nature. I love hiking up the mountain, biking in nature. The fresh air, fresh smell, and fresh sound makes me so relaxed and fresh. </li>
            <li>I am into fish and cat. Having fish is like having a stress releaser. They are really lovely. Cats are extremely adorable. Their soft fur, sound and those eyes make me want to say “Awww”. </li>

            <li>I really don’t like snakes. I think they are really different from other animals. They poison, even though some of them don’t. They looks really………. x_x</li>
            <li>I don't like the taste of bitter or salty. When I eat something bitter or salty. I always feel like there something stuck in my mouth for a whole day. </li>
