<p class="letter">In my academy, there are so many things going on. A lot of opportunities and a lot of blood-sweat-and-tear moment. Our mission is to change Cambodia. It’s such a huge task to do. To complete our mission, we have something called Exploration. This project is to find discover something about Cambodia and somehow develop it or study more about it. We have four explorations in every school year. </p>

<p class="letter">Hmmm, my favorite subject. I actually have no favorite subject. I used to love math and STEM so much. However, it's getting harder and harder. I don’t hate them, but don’t love them either. I actually fall in love with acting, writing coding. However, it’s not one of our subjects. We have some time to study and develop those two things, but there is no class( I meant there’s used to).
